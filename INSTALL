This is the SIMPLE approach to yubikey and freeradius. You don't need any additional servers.
Keys stand on the radius server. Authentication is all done locally. No xml (saml) traveling over the net.
This is fast and easy and simple. It's for small and medium organisations that do not need enterprise stuff and certainly do not need a fancy web interface. The freeradius module uses a conf file. I do not want a database, as it's another point of failure and remember that the radius authentication is quite important for an organisation.
It has a SIMPLE configuration file that keeps track of everything you need. (see users.sample)

This project uses yubico-low-level library and libconfig. A couple of files have been moved into the project to simplify things even more. You do not need to install other stuff. Just compile radius with this module.
To do this:

1. Untar the freeradius sources.
2. Create a directory called src/modules/rlm_yubikey
3. svn checkout there
4. configure && make && make install

Location of the config file is hardcoded for now. Feel free to modify the code as you wish. Eventually send me the modifications so I can update this.

This code uses the yubico-c-read-only library hosted at google-code and libconfig.
To simplify things even further I included everything in there.
